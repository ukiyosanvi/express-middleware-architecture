/**
 * Express Middleware Architecture — Build the Pipeline
 *
 * This Express app already has TWO routers mounted (/posts and /users) and NO
 * custom middleware written yet. Your job is to write three middleware and mount
 * them correctly:
 *
 *   1) requestId — attaches a UUID to req (and the X-Request-Id header)   [GLOBAL]
 *   2) logger    — logs method, path, and status                          [GLOBAL]
 *   3) timing    — logs how many milliseconds the request took            [GLOBAL]
 *
 * Then show ONE example of PER-ROUTE mounting vs GLOBAL mounting by mounting the
 * provided auditWrite middleware on a single route only (see routes/posts.js).
 *
 * Run it with:  npm start
 */
